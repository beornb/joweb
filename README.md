# Jo-Ann Bishop - Personal Portfolio

This is the personal portfolio website for Jo-Ann Bishop, a seasoned expert in Product Marketing and Product Design. This site showcases her work, skills, and professional journey.

The project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
