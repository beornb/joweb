                        <p>When South African Airways approached us, their request was straightforward - to redesign their existing smartphone app, giving it a modern look-and-feel that would bump their customers’ user experience up a class. </p>

                            <p>SAA wanted to give their users an app that it would be as intuitive and easy to use as possible. This meant using a user centred approach to ensure that the app looks appealing, works efficiently and enables their users to manage their flights and bookings seamlessly.
                            <br>
                            SAA’s previous app was created in HTML5, which meant that functionality was limited for the type of experience SAA expected for their users. Competitors in the same space with similarly functioning apps provided booking and tracking-like functionalities which SAA did not.

                            <p>I was the UX / UI Designer on the project. I took care of translating requirements, wireframing screens, designing the layout and working closely with the development team to make sure the App was developed to a high standard. </p>

                                <p>Our solution was to rebuild the smartphone app natively, ensuring that we could create a more sophisticated user experience with a revised interface followed my usability best practices. By implementing an all-native infrastructure, we also ensured that the SAA smartphone app had the right foundation to be able to add features more easily in the future.</p>
